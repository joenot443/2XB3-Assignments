- I used the lang3 version of StopWatch because it included a method called getNanoTime() which allowed me to time the functions more precisely. GetNanoTime() returns the StopWatchâ€™s time expressed in ns, rather than ms. The time was still converted into seconds, as per the requirements of the project.
